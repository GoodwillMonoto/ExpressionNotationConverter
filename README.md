# Design Decisions

Created the Coverter a class library making it easer to use in other project.

# Testing

To test the component I would  first identify the core areas functionality.

I would then prepare a list of test cases for the individual areas.

I would test both path success and failure paths.

I would ensure input validation done and security tests are conducted as well.

I would also ensure to include tests that evaluate performance

I would conduct these tests with a test library such as xunit.
